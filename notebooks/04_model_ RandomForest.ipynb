    "## Conclusions RandomForest\n",
    "1.\tThe model showed a very high overall accuracy (accuracy of about 0.9999) and a very good ability to detect fraud even with a modified threshold (threshold = 0.7), which allows for better control of the trade-off between false positives and false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tThe recall for the Fraud class reached 95.8%, which is a very high rate - the model detects almost all cases of fraud.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tThe F1-measure for Fraud was in the range of ~0.95-0.98, which indicates a balance between precision and recall, and a very good ability of the model to work with a difficult (less represented) class.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.\tROC AUC ~0.99+, which confirms the model's excellent ability to separate classes even at different probability thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.\tEasy retraining is possible, as some models had perfect metrics on the test set (e.g., 100% accuracy for the Legit class and almost 96% recall for Fraud). This may indicate that the model has partially adjusted to the data and should be tested on a completely independent dataset."
